## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
  
### Continued development

- Grid CSS is a concept that I'm still learning how to use and is very helpful in design terms.
- On future projects I hope to implement JavaScript into the page, for a more interactive page for the user. Stay tuned!

### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - This helped me to undestand the syntax of the Grid Layout in CSS.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - This is an amazing website to view colors with pickers and create palettes.
